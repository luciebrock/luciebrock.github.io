[![valetbike theme](images/bg.png)](https://valetbike-kales.herokuapp.com/)

worked on a team of 5 to produce a bikesharing app for the final project in introduction to software engineering. using ruby on rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a lot of redbull, our team produced a sleek and straightforward minimum viable product. **our team won the 2022 Demo Day** for our course, in which all 6 teams in the class presented their bike sharing app (under the name ValetBike), and competed for the best MVP.

produced a "calculator" (of sorts) with a classmate (and dear friend) that produces some ~pretty math art~ using modulo addition/multiplicaiton tables, does the euclidean/reverse euclidean formula, has a binary search visualization, and a few other random methods. this project was presented for the end of year art show in discrete mathemtatics. have a look!
