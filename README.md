# Little Projects
[![bee model](images/bee_game.png)](https://replit.com/@lmbrock/BuzzQuest)

This is a game (generously put) made using JavaScript, HTML, and Blender. For instructions on how to use it, see the readme. Check it out!

[![the player character](images/little_ghost2.png)](https://replit.com/@alinemarrap/Anamnesis)

This game was made in collaboration with 2 classmates. It is a robust text-based adventure game titled Anamnesis, made in Java (with the guava package). The project includes around 5,000 words of flavor text, and a compelling plot line. Try it out!

[![mod26 table](images/mod25.png)](https://replit.com/@lmbrock/artShow)

This is a "calculator" (of sorts) made with a classmate (and dear friend) that produces ~pretty math art~ using modulo addition/multiplicaiton tables, does the euclidean/reverse euclidean formula, has a binary search visualization, and a few other random methods. Have a look!
