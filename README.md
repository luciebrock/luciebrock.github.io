# About

I am a Smith College student graduating in May 2024, with a double major in CS & Philosophy. I am interested in ethics of AI and ethical computing practice. For the past two summers, I have worked in Virginia as a Transportation Safety Engineering intern at MITRE. This past spring I spent six months at the University of Oxford as a visiting student. 
Outside of academia, I am the president of the Smith College Vibes a capella group, I play guitar, enjoy minecraft, and have a passion for collecting gadgets and gizmos.

# Projects
[![bee model](images/bee_game.png)](https://replit.com/@lmbrock/BuzzQuest)

I made a game (generously put) using JavaScript, HTML, and Blender. For instructions on how to use it, see the readme. This project was made for a final project in my Computer Graphics course. Check it out!

I worked on a team of 5 to produce a bikesharing app for the final project in introduction to software engineering. Using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a lot of redbull, our team produced a sleek and straightforward minimum viable product. **Our team won the 2022 Demo Day** for our course, in which all 6 teams in the class presented their bike sharing app (under the name ValetBike), and competed for the best MVP. Check out our repository!

I collaborated with a team of 2 students to produce a robust text-based adventure game titled anamnesis in java (with the guava package). The project **recieved a 30/30 (100%) score** as a final project in introduction to data structures, a highly competitive and challenging course. The project includes around 5,000 words of flavor text, and a compelling plot line. Try it out!

I produced a "calculator" (of sorts) with a classmate (and dear friend) that produces ~pretty math art~ using modulo addition/multiplicaiton tables, does the euclidean/reverse euclidean formula, has a binary search visualization, and a few other random methods. This project was presented for the end of year art show in discrete mathemtatics. Have a look!
