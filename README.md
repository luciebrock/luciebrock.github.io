worked on a team of 5 to produce a bikesharing app for the final project in introduction to software engineering. using ruby on rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a lot of redbull, our team produced a sleek and straightforward MVP. our team **won** the 2022 Demo Day for our course, in which all 6 teams in the class presented their bike sharing app (under the name ValetBike), and competed for the best minimum viable product.
